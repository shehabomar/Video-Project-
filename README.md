# Claws of Intrigue: NYUAD's Mysterious Events

## Project Description

The Claws of Intrigue: NYUAD’s Mysterious Events is an interesting crime documentary hosted on an equally unconventionally-designed website. The core concept behind this project is to document a series of unfortunate events on the campus and then help the user uncover what actually went on. We do this not just through impactful shots but also by using dialogues that portray emotions in the best possible way. We aimed to create a mysterious and fun experience with a touch of humor at the end to engage our audience.
To visually represent the project, we designed a logo that resembles the signature tattoo a gang of cats could possibly have in an alternate reality. In the logo, the users can see a cat and four claws which if the user pays enough attention to, would uncover the mystery for them. We also kept the website’s design visually simple, using a plain white background with black text, and blue and yellow colors to resonate with the logo.


## Process

Implementing The Claws of Intrigue: NYUAD’s Mysterious Events was a collaborative effort that involved various tasks, including booking equipment and learning to work with it, script writing, casting actors, video shooting, audio recording,  video editing, web design, logo design, and much more. We followed a structured process to bring this project to life.

### 1) Task Distribution
- Script Writing: Although all of us contributed to the script as the script required constant improvisation, the initial script was written by Youssef and adapted by Youssab and me. 
- Casting Actors: The actors were chosen by Youssef, Youssab and Omar mostly. 
- Video Shooting and Audio Recording: The shooting process was the most time consuming one. Each shot required several takes and retakes. We also had to figure out the best way to record the audio without the microphone appearing in the video. We also lost footage several times due to battery running out and such issues. All of us shot together. 
- Video Editing: Youssab and Omar spent countless hours in the editlab, editing the video.
- Web Design: Creating the web interface involved designing a user-friendly and visually appealing layout. We integrated the main documentary along with behind the scenes videos to create a seamless and fun filled user experience.
- Logo Design: The project's visual identity, including the logo design, was a crucial element in conveying the audio experience. The logo with the text was crafted to symbolize the core concept.


### 2) Collaboration and Deadlines
 
We set deadlines and milestones for each aspect of the project to ensure a smooth development process. Regular meetings and communication were done for coordinating efforts and tracking progress.

### 3) Audio Editing

Editing over 8 video and audio files, and combining the different videos together with seamless transitions presented a substantial challenge and a lot of thought went into it. However, we successfully incorporated many of our recorded audio and video  files, ensuring a rich and diverse visual and audio experience for users.

## Reflection/Evaluation
In retrospect, our journey in developing The Claws of Intrigue: NYUAD’s Mysterious Events was marked by both challenges and achievements. The initial learning curve in mastering the audio and video  equipment and dealing with background noise proved to be a valuable experience, eventually leading to high-quality audio and video recordings. Editing and integrating numerous audio and video files for each of the victims and witnesses presented a time-consuming yet rewarding task, ensuring a diverse and immersive experience for users. Despite these hurdles, we successfully delivered on our objective to provide an insightful and engaging crime documentary based in the NYUAD community. In conclusion, the project has not only met our expectations but also exceeded them by offering an authentic and immersive crime documentary.
